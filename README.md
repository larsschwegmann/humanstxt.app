humanstxt.app
=============

[Humans.txt is available on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/humans.txt/id530167394?mt=8)

Description
-----------
An App to retrieve and parse the humans.txt file of a website.
Visit http://humanstxt.org for more information on humans.txt.
Please note that this App won't work for every humans.txt file.
It was programmed to parse the syntax declared at http://humanstxt.org/standard.html.
Sites like Google (http://www.google.com/humans.txt) don't use the standard syntax, so this App won't display the Information correctly.

License
-------
In addition to the BSD-2 license below, I ask that you do not publicly distribute the app as a whole in binary form (e.g. on the App Store).
